# Color dial
The color dial is an application that uses a color sensor to make a needle on a dial point towards the color it sees. To achieve this it makes use of a Lego Mindstorms color sensor and servo motor.

To compile it yourself you will need the [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) compiler installed on your system and the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner.

To build the program you then simply run:
```bash
just build
```
