# Binary counter
The binary counter is a simple program that uses 4 LEDs and two buttons. One button counts up and one button counts down. The LEDs show the state of 4 bit counter.

To compile it yourself you will need the [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) compiler installed on your system and the [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner.

To build the program you then simply run:
```bash
just build
```
